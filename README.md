# Pomodoro
It`s a pomodoro clock made in pycharm using tkinter for a GUI, it can be fully customizable for your needs, all you need to do is change the minutes on the CONSTANTS and it will automatically update, and if you want to take it forward you can import cx_Freeze to make it an app on your pc.

Have fun using it or modify it for yur needs.
